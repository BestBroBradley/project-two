    p.body#aboutUs Welcome to the Tabletop Tap!  When we opened our doors in 2018, we wanted to create a space for gamers of all kinds to celebrate their favorite hobbies.  Whether you're an old-school arcade fan, a board-game lover--or just looking for a place to hang out and enjoy one of our 20 craft brews on tap--we hope you'll love your time here.
